Welcome to the Food Donation App, a platform that allows users to donate food and help those in need. This app is designed using Android Studio and Firebase, with Java and Kotlin as the primary programming languages. As population is increasing day by day.
Our current population is approximately 1.482 billion 17.7% of the whole world’s population. To feed such big population we need a good amount of food, shelter and other necessiti es. To fulfil other needs people are continuously destroying farmlands, forests and other natural resources, which results in decreasing of food production. The scenario is something that some have more than requirements and some are yearning for a single piece of food. Such peoples include various children(our future) and every age-group people. And those have more than requirements they are wasting it. They enjoying new-new dishes and waste the leftover in bins or throw in manholes. This all scene gave us an idea why not track the wasted food waste, so it can be used for good purpose like donation, feeding it to cattle’s or transporting for making natural manure and fertilizer. 
So we introduced a FOOD-Donation APP [FOOD4ALL] which helps us to donate food to various NGO’s(Non- Governmental Organizations) who helps a lots of people on daily basis. Everyone who wants to donate food can donate with the help of our APP. People having fresh leftover food can donate to NGO’s, Orphanages, Old-Age homes where lots of life struggling to make their livings. And if the donor does not have fresh food(1-2 day leftover & good condition), he/she can donate that food to cattle farmers who does cattle farming on big-scale. This will help them a lot. In weddings lots of food is wasted or leftover food is thrown, people can donate that food too. Such little donations can save numbers of lives.
